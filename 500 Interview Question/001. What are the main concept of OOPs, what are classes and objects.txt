The main concept of OOPS is object, class, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.
A class is a Logical Unit or Blueprint that contains fields, methods, and properties.
class members are:
1. Contructor: 
	- It is a special method that is used to initialize the state of an object.
	- It is invoked at the time of object creation.
	- It is a special type of method that has the same name as class name and no return type.
	- It is used to allocate memory to an object.

2. Fields: 
	- It is a variable that is declared in a class.
	- It represents the state of an object.
	- It is also known as data member.

3. Properties
	- It is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field.

4. Methods
	- It is a block of code that contains a series of statements.
	- It is a group of statements that are used to perform an operation.
	- It is executed by calling it from another method.

5. Events
	- It is a message sent by an object to signal the occurrence of an action.
	- It is used to provide a user interface.
